'''
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:

Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

#Approach 1: Priority Queues
'''
Time Complexity: O(NlogN).

There are two major portions that take up time here. One is sorting of the array that takes O(NlogN) considering that the array consists of N elements.
Then we have the min-heap. In t)he worst case, all N meetings will collide with each other. In any case we have NN add operations on the heap.
In the worst case we will have N extract-min operations as well. Overall complexity being (NlogN) since extract-min operation on a heap takes O(logN).
Space Complexity: O(N because we construct the min-heap and that can contain NN elements in the worst case as described above in the time complexity section.
Hence, the space complexity is O(N).

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        # If there is no meeting to schedule then no room needs to be allocated.
        if not intervals:
            return 0

        # The heap initialization
        free_rooms = []

        # Sort the meetings in increasing order of their start time.
        intervals.sort(key= lambda x: x[0])

        # Add the first meeting. We have to give a new room to the first meeting.
        heapq.heappush(free_rooms, intervals[0][1])

        # For all the remaining meeting rooms
        for i in intervals[1:]:

            # If the room due to free up the earliest is free, assign that room to this meeting.
            if free_rooms[0] <= i[0]:
                heapq.heappop(free_rooms)

            # If a new room is to be assigned, then also we add to the heap,
            # If an old room is allocated, then also we have to add to the heap with updated end time.
            heapq.heappush(free_rooms, i[1])

        # The size of the heap tells us the minimum rooms required for all the meetings.
        return len(free_rooms)
#Approach 2: Chronological Ordering
'''
Time Complexity: O(NlogN) because all we are doing is sorting the two arrays for start timings and end timings individually and 
each of them would contain NN elements considering there are N intervals.

Space Complexity:O(N) because we create two separate arrays of size NN, one for recording the start times and one for the end times.
