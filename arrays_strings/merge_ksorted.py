'''
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

Intuition & Algorithm

This approach walks alongside the one above but is improved a lot. We don't need to traverse most nodes many times repeatedly
-Pair up k lists and merge each pair.
-After the first pairing, k lists are merged into k/2 lists with average 2N/k length, then k/4, k/8 and so on.
-Repeat this procedure until we get the final sorted linked list.
-Thus, we'll traverse almost NN nodes per pairing and merging, and repeat this procedure about logk times.

Time complexity : O(Nlogk) where \text{k}k is the number of linked lists.
Space complexity : O(1)O(1)
