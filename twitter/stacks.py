'''
Create a simple stack which takes a list of elements.
Each element contains a stack operator (push, pop, inc) and a value to either push/pop or two values, n and m,
which increment the bottom n values by m.
Then print the topmost value of the stack after every operation. If the stack is empty, print "empty"
