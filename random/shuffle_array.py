'''
Given an integer array nums, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array.

Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
int[] reset() Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
int[] shuffle() Returns a random shuffling of the array.

Intuition
We can cut down the time and space complexities of shuffle with a bit of cleverness - namely, by swapping elements around within the array itself, we can avoid the linear space cost of the auxiliary array and the linear time cost of list modification.

Algorithm
The Fisher-Yates algorithm is remarkably similar to the brute force solution. On each iteration of the algorithm, we generate a random integer between the current index and the last index of the array. Then, we swap the elements at the current index and the chosen index - this simulates drawing (and removing) the element from the hat, as the next range from which we select a random index will not include the most recently processed one. One small, yet important detail is that it is possible to swap an element with itself - otherwise, some array permutations would be more likely than others. To see this illustrated more clearly, consider the animation below:
'''

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.array = nums
        self.original = list(nums)

    def reset(self):
        self.array = self.original
        self.original = list(self.original)
        return self.array

    def shuffle(self):
        for i in range(len(self.array)):
            swap_idx = random.randrange(i, len(self.array))
            self.array[i], self.array[swap_idx] = self.array[swap_idx], self.array[i]
        return self.array
