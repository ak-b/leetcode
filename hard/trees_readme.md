Tree is a special type of graphs, so the two usual techniques used to traverse a graph are also applicable to trees.

We recommend: 
+ Word Ladder
+ Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree 
+ Course Schedule
+ Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
+ Alien Dictionary

Note that some of the tree problems can also be asked in n-ary tree format, so make sure you know what an n-ary tree is.

Note: The last problem may be quite tricky to solve, so feel free to skip that one.
